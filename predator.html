        <img class="alien-size " src="predator/wolf.jpg">
        <h4 class="alien-h4">Wolf</h4>
        <p class="alienP">Wolf was a veteran Yautja and relentless Xenomorph hunter who arrived on Earth to contain a Xenomorph outbreak in Gunnison, Colorado in 2004.
           He killed at least five humans of the town,
           slayed many Xenomorphs and fought a Predalien in combat. </p>

      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 ALIEN2-html">
      <img class="alien-size " src="predator/celtic.jpg">
      <h4 class="alien-h4">Celtic</h4>
      <p class="alienP">Although each of the Predators was a relatively inexperienced juvenile, Celtic was the oldest of the three brothers and acted as the leader of the group.
         During the ritual hunt, he killed at least one human and engaged the Xenomorph Grid in single combat.
          However, despite initially having the upper-hand, his overconfidence ultimately got the better of him and he was killed by the Drone.
           As a result, Celtic failed to slay any aliens and thus never became Blooded. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 ALIEN3-html">
        <img class="alien-size  " src="predator/dark.jpg">
        <h4 class="alien-h4">Dark</h4>
        <p class="alienP">Dark was an Elite Yautja from the Elite Clan. He was dispatched by his clan Elders along with Wolf and one other Predator to BG-386,
           to investigate a distress call sent by the Young Blood Pack.
           He subsequently became involved in a large-scale Xenomorph outbreak on the planet and also came into conflict with the United States Colonial Marine Corps. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12  ALIEN4-html">
        <img class="alien-size " src="predator/scar.jpg">
        <h4 class="alien-h4">Scar</h4>
        <p class="alienP">Scar was the youngest and smartest of the three brothers, and was the only Predator to succeed in killing a Xenomorph and thereby gain his Blooded status; he in fact killed several of the creatures,
           including a Queen, which he defeated with the assistance of Lex Woods.
            Despite his successes, Scar was mortally wounded by the Queen and died soon after the creature was slain. </p>
